        to integrate with your existing issue tracking system.</p>

    <p>Maintaining maximum uptime of your lecture capture infrastructure is imperative, and Recorder Monitor
        allows you to ensure that your users have the best experience possible by being aware of issues with
        recorders in almost real-time<sup>*</sup>. Notify staff, technicians, and/or issue tracking system
